Starfleet Academy Simulator - Welcome to Starfleet Academy. The academy was established in 2161. Our motto is Ex Astris Scientia, or
"From the Stars, Knowledge". Starfleet believes that exploration of the stars leads to wisdom, discovery, and progress.

In this simulator, you will begin your academics through vigorous study in Command, Diplomacy, Engineering, Security, Science and
Medicine. Once your studies are complete, you will begin a labs section. This section provides the student with the opportunity
to apply what they have learned through interactive scenarios. When the student has successfully completed all labs, they will
complete exams for each department and their progress will be measured.

Each student cadet will compete against 9 other students in the exams section, and each student cadet will be required to maintain
a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0. Students who fall short will not be offered a commission in Starfleet. Students who finish
with a 3.0 or better GPA will continue to a "Kobayashi Maru" simulation, the classic no win tactical test. The simulation does
not impact the student's graduation. After the completion of the simulation, the student cadet will attend a debrief. Once
all of these requirements have been met, the student cadet will be offered a commission as an Ensign in Starfleet and will be
given their first assignment orders.
