# Starfleet_Academy

This is a Starfleet Academy simulator. As a new cadet, you will sign the new cadet registration and begin your training.
You will be required to attend classes and you will study until you have completed the course work. At the conclusion of
your training, you will take a final exam. The results of the exam will determine if you are promoted to ensign. If you
do not qualify for promotion, you may either "wash out" or start over.
